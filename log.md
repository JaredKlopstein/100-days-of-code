# 100 Days Of Code

### Day 0: August 29th, 2024

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Worked through parts of #TheOdinProject
2. Started an html-boilerplate repo which I will use for learning/creating new similiar web pages.

**Thoughts:** In the past I struggled staying motivated without tutorials. This time around holding myself accountable will be important. That is why I think this 100 Days of Code will be extremely helpful. Coding outside of tutorials will be helpful to enforce my knowledge.
